An implementation of Hubot and Hubot-IRC. Seeks to provide functions that aid Twitch users. Inspired by Rise Kujikawa of Persona 4.

This bot does NOT aim to replace administrative/moderation bots like Moobot and Nightbot, so none of its functions will utilize commands requiring operator status in a channel.
