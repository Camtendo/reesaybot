An implementation of Hubot and Hubot-IRC. Seeks to provide functions that aid Twitch users. Inspired by Rise Kujikawa of Persona 4. Named "reesaybot" to help English speakers pronounce her name.

This bot does NOT aim to replace administrative/moderation bots like Moobot and Nightbot, so none of its functions will utilize commands requiring operator status in a channel (for now). 

Notable Features
=========
* Saltybet style betting
* Interaction with the Twitch.tv API (Checking viewers, checking followers, changing game/status, etc.)
* Interaction with the Challonge API (Updating tournament matches, fetching match history, starting bets from matches, etc.)
* Interaction with the Dropbox API using Challonge data to autoupdate files that Open Broadcasting Software (OBS) can read
* Fundamental Pokedex functionality

TODO
=========
* SRL style Racebot features (start race, stop race, participants, race rating, etc.)
* World Record fetching
* Administrative actions (banning, timeouts, etc.)
