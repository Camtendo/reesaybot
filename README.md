An implementation of Hubot and Hubot-IRC. Seeks to provide functions that aid Twitch users. Inspired by Rise Kujikawa of Persona 4. Named "reesaybot" to help English speakers pronounce her name.

This bot does NOT aim to replace administrative/moderation bots like Moobot and Nightbot, so none of its functions will utilize commands requiring operator status in a channel. 

Notable Features
=========
* Saltybet style betting
* Interaction with the Twitch.tv API (Checking viewers, checking followers, changing game/status, etc.)

TODO
=========
* SRL style Racebot features (start race, stop race, participants, race rating, etc.)
* World Record fetching
